                  Hello! I am a determined individual who embarked on a journey
                  into the world of technology with a passion for innovation and
                  problem-solving. My academic journey led me to pursue a degree
                  in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Computer Systems at
                  Vaal University of Technology, where I began my studies in
                  2020.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The road wasn't always easy, but I held onto my perseverance
                  and commitment, ensuring that I did not give up on my dreams.
                  Along the way, I discovered my deep interest in software
                  development and its incredible potential for innovation. In
                  June 2023, I took a significant step in my career by
                  participating in a short Azure program at Dynamic DNA. This
                  experience provided me with valuable insights into cloud
                  technologies, enhancing my skills and knowledge in the rapidly
                  evolving tech landscape.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Shortly after, in September, I secured a Full Stack Java
                  Software Development learnership â€” an opportunity that allowed
                  me to immerse myself in the field of technology. Throughout
                  this journey, I gained hands-on experience and practiced
                  various aspects of full-stack development. Working within a
                  dynamic team, we collaborated on numerous projects, honing my
                  skills and exposing me to the multifaceted nature of software
                  development.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This collective experience has not only equipped me with
                  technical expertise but also instilled in me a deep
                  appreciation for teamwork, effective communication, and the
                  constant pursuit of learning. I am excited about the endless
                  possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing
                  my skills and passion to the ever-evolving tech industry.
